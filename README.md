# tdd-project

Starting files for doing TDD with Express, Mocha, and Chai

# Using the project

Download the files and unzip into a folder, then navigate to the folder in a Git Bash window (or start a new terminal in Visual Studio Code), enter "npm install". You will see the necessary files installed in the node_modules folder

To run the existing tests, type "npm test" in the terminal window. You should see the results for two passing tests.

# Setup information

The package.json file points to older versions of the Mocha and Chai libraries. This is to be able to run tests from older tutorials which are not based on CommonJS modules.
